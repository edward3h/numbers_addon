# Contributing

## Feedback
You can open feature requests or bug reports as 
[issues](issues). Please check 
if there is a relevant existing issue before opening a new one, and
include as much detail as you can in your issue.

## Documentation
If you can improve the documentation, feel free to submit a pull request or
add to the project Wiki.

## Coding
Feel free to submit pull requests for fixes or enhancements.

The generator code is a [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) build script, so you will need Java installed. In addition, [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) is required to generate the images.

The Gradle logic is written in [Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org/index.html), so you may want to refer to that documentation as well.

I recommend using IntelliJ IDEA as IDE since it seems to have the best support
for Gradle and Groovy, however I sometimes use VS Code too.
